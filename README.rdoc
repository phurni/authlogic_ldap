http://authlogic-ldap.rubyforge.org

== DESCRIPTION:

This gem is still under development and is not completed yet, but when it's done it will be a plugin for
Authlogic to allow for LDAP authentication.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Authentication against a database before checking LDAP.
Create a user in the database, if they exist in LDAP.

== SYNOPSIS:

== REQUIREMENTS:

* authlogic
* ruby-net-ldap

== INSTALL:

* script/plugin install git://github.com/pol/authlogic_ldap.git
* optionally add ldap user/pass columns to your user model
* add ldap configuration options to your user and sessions models

== EXAMPLE:

After installing the plugin, I decide I do not wish to add ldap_user and ldap_password columns to my database.

I add the following to my User model:

  acts_as_authentic do |config|
    config.validate_ldap_login false
  end

This makes it so that there won't be any validations run on the ldap_login column (because I don't have one).

Next, I edit the UserSession model and add some configuration options:

  ldap_host                 'ldapserver.myschool.edu'
  ldap_login_format         "uid=%s,ou=People,o=ldapserver.myschool.edu,o=cp"
  find_by_ldap_login_method :find_by_login

These are likely to be different for your particular setup.  The last config option is to set the ActiveRecord finder for my user to be "find_by_login" because I don't have an ldap_login column.

And, that should do it.  The system expects that your users exist in the local system *before* they are authenticated to the LDAP server.  This will be made more functional in the future (see the Todo.rdoc for more information.)
